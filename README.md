## Project Set Up

Login/Signup Pages: A mentor can login in to an existing account with Username, and Password and a Phone Number or a user can sign up for an account with a username, and password and phone number. An e-mail address should be connected with an account creation.

Home Page: on login a user is sent to a list view page where they can see a list of their recent messages they’ve created, and a list of the schedules they’ve created.

Message Page: User can login and create the text or voice messages to be sent. For the MVP you do not need to include the ability to create new contacts.

Scheduling Page: User can create a message schedule to be automatically sent by adding a group of contacts, date to be sent, and selecting the message to be sent.  

Notifications: When it's time for the message to be sent, recipient will receive text notifications through Twilio sent to their phone or whatsapp number entered by the mentor.

Edit Message Schedule Page: user can edit and/or delete a message from their schedule.

Stretch: Allow a mentor to create/import contact information for the clients they mentor. Allow a 2nd user type (board member) to be able to log in and see trainer’s profiles based on an invitation. They can also Create, Read, Update and Delete messages to send client groups.
